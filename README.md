# DIfferentiable Motion Planning (DIMP)

## Installation

Create a [Python virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) or whatever you enjoy.
If you do not use a virtual environment named `.venv`, you will need to change the `.vscode/settings.json` file accordingly.

Create the virtual environment with:
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
```
Activate the virtual environment (on Ubuntu) with:
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Install the package with:
```bash
pip3 install hatchling
pip3 install -e .
```

## Usage

So empty...

## Development

### Pre-commit hooks

Pre commit hooks are used to clean up Jupyter notebooks.

Install pre-commit with:
```bash
pip3 install pre-commit
```

To install pre-commit hooks, run:
```bash
pre-commit install
```

## Notebooks

After trying out [Marimo](https://marimo.io/), I decided to go back to Jupyter notebooks.
Sad.
